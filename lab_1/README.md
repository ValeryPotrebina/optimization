1. Unimodality Check:
    Implement functions to check the unimodality of a function on a given interval [a,b] using the first and second derivatives.

2. Optimization Methods:

Implement four optimization methods to find the minimum of a function on a given interval [a,b]:
    * Exhaustive Search Method: Divides the interval into equal parts and computes the function value at each point. The point with the minimum function value is considered the approximate solution.
    * Bisection Method: Gradually narrows the search interval by discarding the half of the interval where the function cannot have a minimum.
    * Golden Section Method: Uses the golden ratio to efficiently narrow the search interval.
    * Fibonacci Method: Uses Fibonacci numbers to narrow the search interval.
