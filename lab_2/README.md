description:
1. Unimodality Check:
    Implement functions to check the unimodality of a function on a given interval [a,b] using the first and second derivatives.
   
Implement four optimization methods to find the minimum of a function on a given interval [a,b]:
3. Optimization Methods:

<ul>
    <li>Exhaustive Search Method: Divides the interval into equal parts and computes the function value at each point. </li>
    <li>Bisection Method: Gradually narrows the search interval by discarding the half of the interval where the function cannot have a minimum.</li>
    <li>Golden Section Method: Uses the golden ratio to efficiently narrow the search interval.</li>
    <li>Fibonacci Method: Uses Fibonacci numbers to narrow the search interval.</li>
</ul>
